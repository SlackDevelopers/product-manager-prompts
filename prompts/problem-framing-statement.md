<!-- 
## Description:
This template is designed to guide product managers in socializing & articulating a problem statement that effectively communicates the core issues to be addressed. 
Emphasizing the "who" and "why" frames the problem from the persona's perspective, incorporating their pains, gains, and jobs to be done and ensuring a deep understanding before seeking solutions.

## Usage Note:
This template should be employed in Generative AI sessions after ensuring comprehensive context on the customer's pains, gains, jobs to be done, and the target problem space has been established. 
If adequate context is absent, the generative AI session agent (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, etc.) 
is instructed to prompt the product manager to provide more details to ensure the problem is thoroughly understood.

## Instructions:
1. Verify the session includes detailed context as described above.
2. Follow the prompt below to use the Problem Framing Canvas:

"Based on the session context, our customer's pains, gains, and jobs to be done, and our target problem space, 
please fill out the Problem Framing Canvas using the template below, rendered as Markdown in a Code Block. 
If you feel the context provided is insufficient, please prompt me (the product manager) for additional information."

## Problem Framing Canvas Template

<!--
Based on the session context, frame the problem from the persona perspective, enumerate context & constraints from a JTBD perspective,
and create a single sentence providing a powerful and empathetic summary narrative.

If the user has not provided enough context, the session agent of the generative AI chatbot should ask a series of questions to
obtain the context needed to fill in the blanks of the template.
-->
