# reverse-engineer-IEEE830srs-to-PRD-prompt-template.md
<!--
## Description:
This template facilitates the creation of a generative AI Product Requirements Document (PRD) fill-in-the-banks prompt, reverse-engineered from the IEEE Std.830-1998 Software Requirements Specification (SRS). It enables product managers to craft structured and detailed fill-in-the-banks PRD prompts suitable for use with AI tools like ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini. The goal is to generate and then use customizable fill-in-the-blank PRD prompt templates for generative AI that meet the specific needs of various products.

## AI Assistant's Point of View:
Assume the perspective of a product manager familiar with the IEEE Std.830-1998 SRS. Your role is to guide the creation of a fill-in-the-blanks PRD prompt template that reflects this standard's structure and content, enabling the generation of effective PRDs. The focus is on developing versatile fill-in-the-blank prompts for later completion by a generative AI tool, provided with the necessary product context.

## AI Assistant's Task:
Aid the user in translating the IEEE Std.830-1998 SRS into a flexible fill-in-the-banks PRD prompt template. Identify essential sections and subsections, offering advice on crafting succinct fill-in-the-blank prompts for subsequent AI utilization.

## Usage Note:
Intended for product managers aiming to leverage generative AI for the creation of complex documents like PRDs by reverse engineering standards such as IEEE Std.830-1998 SRS.

## Instructions:
1. Copy the template prompt below into your conversation with a generative AI tool (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini).
2. Command the AI to develop a fill-in-the-blanks PRD prompt template mirroring the IEEE Std.830-1998 SRS format.
3. Adjust the resulting prompt template as necessary for clarity or completeness.
4. Employ the finalized PRD prompt template with generative AI to draft detailed PRDs specific to various products, following the embedded usage instructions.

## Roles

Let's collaborate as a product management team.

## Task

1. Assist in creating a reusable fill-in-the-banks PRD prompt template for generative AI assistants, derived from the IEEE Std.830-1998 SRS.
2. Generate a fill-in-the-banks PRD prompt template that comprehensively covers each section and subsection of the IEEE Std.830-1998 SRS. Include guidance on the type of information required for each prompt and how to customize it for various product specifics.
3. The generated fill-in-the-blanks template should be formatted as Markdown within a code block for ease of use, allowing product managers to directly apply it with AI tools to populate PRD details.
4. Incorporate instructions on optimizing the template with AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) to generate fill-in-the-banks PRDs tailored to unique product needs. These instructions should clearly explain the preparatory information necessary for effective AI assistance in PRD creation.

## Example

Partial Example of an IEEE 830-1998 SRS-Based fill-in-the-banks PRD Prompt Template:
