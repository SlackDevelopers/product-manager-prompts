<!--
## Description:
This template facilitates the creation of a generative AI Product Requirements Document (PRD) fill-in-the-banks prompt, reverse-engineered from the IEEE Std.830-1998 Software Requirements Specification (SRS). It enables product managers to craft structured and detailed fill-in-the-banks PRD prompts suitable for use with AI tools like ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini. The goal is to generate and then use customizable PRD prompt templates so generative AI can fill in the blanks in a way that meets the specific needs of various products.

## AI Assistant's Point of View:
Assume the perspective of a product manager familiar with the IEEE Std.830-1998 SRS. Your role is to guide the creation of a fill-in-the-blanks PRD prompt template that reflects this standard's structure and content, enabling the generation of effective PRDs. The focus is on developing versatile PRD prompts for later completion by a generative AI tool that then fills in the blanks based on the context provided by the product manager.

## AI Assistant's Task:
Aid the user in translating the IEEE Std.830-1998 SRS into a flexible fill-in-the-banks PRD prompt template. Identify essential sections and subsections, offering advice on crafting succinct PRD prompt templates that can later be used by generative AI tools like ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini so the AI can fill in the blanks based on the context provided by the product manager. In other words, the HUMAN doesn't fill in the blanks; the generative AI does.

## Usage Note:
This is intended for product managers who aim to leverage generative AI to create complex document prompt templates like PRDs by reverse engineering standards such as IEEE Std.830-1998 SRS.

## Instructions:
1. Copy the template prompt below into your conversation with a generative AI tool (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini).
2. Command the AI to develop a fill-in-the-blanks PRD prompt template mirroring the IEEE Std.830-1998 SRS format.
3. Adjust the resulting prompt template as necessary for clarity or completeness.
4. Paste the finalized PRD prompt template into your generative AI tool, so it can generate detailed PRDs specific to various products, following the embedded usage instructions.

## Roles

Let's collaborate as a product management team.

## Task

1. Assist in creating a reusable fill-in-the-banks PRD prompt template for generative AI assistants, derived from the IEEE Std.830-1998 SRS.
2. Generate a fill-in-the-banks PRD prompt template that comprehensively covers each section and subsection of the IEEE Std.830-1998 SRS. Include guidance on the type of information required for each prompt and how to customize it for various product specifics.
3. The generated fill-in-the-blanks template should be formatted as Markdown within a code block for ease of use, allowing product managers to directly apply it with AI tools to populate PRD details.
4. Incorporate instructions on optimizing the template with AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) to generate fill-in-the-banks PRDs tailored to unique product needs. These instructions should clearly explain the preparatory information necessary for effective AI assistance in PRD creation.

## Example

Partial Example of an IEEE 830-1998 SRS-Based fill-in-the-banks PRD Prompt Template:

### Software Requirements Specification (SRS) Prompt Template

#### 1. Introduction

a. **Purpose**: 
  - [Clearly define the software product's objective.]
b. **Scope**: 
  - [Enumerate the software product's intended functionalities and features.]
c. **Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations**: 
  - [Clarify technical terms, acronyms, and abbreviations utilized within the document.]

## Goal

The aim is to leverage industry standards for generating adaptable prompt templates that, in turn, generative AI uses to produce a PRD.
In other words, the HUMAN doesn't fill in the blanks; the generative AI does.
