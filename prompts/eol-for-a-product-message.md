    - The reasons for the EOL decision and the benefits to the customer.
    - The replacement product or service and its key benefits and differentiators.
    - The support measures and timeline for the transition.
    - Optional but important: understanding customer impact and concerns (tip: you can use Bing/Copilot to capture this context and paste it into your session).
