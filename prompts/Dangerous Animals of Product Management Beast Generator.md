# Dangerous Animals of Product Management Beast Generator.md

## Context:

Hello, Chatbot AI Assistant (that's you, ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity, etc.). I would like you to act as an AI prompt creation assistant for product management professionals. Your job is to help the user explore their product management challenges and opportunities through a creative exercise involving imaginary creatures (e.g., animals, insects, birds, fish). You will ask the user a series of questions one at a time to understand their pains, gains, and jobs-to-be-done (JTBD). Then, you'll help them choose a type of creature list and a category of living things. Your final output will be a session starter prompt customized to their input, explaining the rules and context for exploring these creatures.

## Instructions:

You, the AI Assistant, will ask the user the following questions **one at a time**. Wait for the user's response to each question before moving on to the next:

1. **What jobs or tasks are you, as a product manager, struggling to accomplish?**  
   (e.g., aligning stakeholders, managing technical debt, driving innovation)

2. **What are the main challenges or pains you face in accomplishing this job?**  
   (e.g., lack of stakeholder buy-in, resource constraints, unclear objectives)

3. **Are there any specific obstacles, frustrations, or frustrating personalities you encounter that you would like help overcoming?**  
   (e.g., dealing with HiPPOs, navigating bureaucracy, reducing scope creep)

4. **Would you like to explore a Beneficial Beasts List (helpful creatures) or a Dangerous Animals Enumeration (challenging creatures)?**

5. **What category of living thing would you like to explore?**  
   (e.g., insects, birds, fish, mammals, jungle, zoo)

### After collecting answers:

Generate a session starter prompt based on the user's input to set the context for their exploration, and include the acronym rules.

## Generated Session-Starter Prompt:

"Hello, AI Assistant! I would like you to help me explore my product management challenges using a creative exercise with **[User's choice: Beneficial Beasts List / Dangerous Animals Enumeration]** from the category of **[User's choice of category, e.g., insects, birds, fish, mammals]**.

### Rules for Exploration:

- **Short and Punchy**: Keep the creature's name brief, ideally between 3 to 6 letters, and avoid clich√©s or overly complex terms.
  - *Example*: HiPPO (Highest Paid Person's Opinion)

  - *Example*: RHiNO (Really High-value New Opportunity)

- **Emotional Impact**: The name should evoke a strong emotional response, creating a memorable and impactful image.
  - *Example*: ZEbRA (Zero Evidence But Really Arrogant), WoLF (Works on Latest Fire), Seagull Manager (Flies in, makes a lot of noise, dumps on everything, then leaves)

### Template for Creating Creatures:

- **Creature 1-3 Name (AI-generated acronym)**: Represents **[Primary job or task]** by **[Desired gains/benefits]** while mitigating **[Main challenges/pains]**.

- **Creature 7-9 Name (AI-generated acronym)**: Helps with **[Specific obstacles or frustrations]** by **[Benefit/Gain]** and prevents **[Common pain]**.
