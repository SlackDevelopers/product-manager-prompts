# backlog-epic-hypothesis.md
<!-- 
## Description:
This template is crafted to facilitate the creation of epics for a product backlog, employing Tim Herbig's hypothesis framework. It provides a structured approach to articulate assumptions about new features, products, or services. By clearly outlining the action or solution for target beneficiaries, the expected outcomes, and the methodology for testing and validation, teams can better navigate the uncertainty inherent in product development.

## Usage Note:
Before using this template in a Generative AI session, ensure the session has been preloaded with context on:
    - The specific action or solution being proposed.
    - The target beneficiaries of this action or solution.
    - The expected desirable outcomes or jobs-to-be-done for the beneficiaries.
    - Ideas for potential experiments to test the hypothesis.
    - Criteria for validating the hypothesis, including both quantitative and qualitative measures.

## Instructions:
1. Confirm the session includes the necessary context as outlined above.
2. Use the following prompt to facilitate the creation of the epic hypothesis:

"Based on the context provided, please create an epic for the product backlog in the style of a Tim Herbig hypothesis using the following Epic Hypothesis Template, rendered as Markdown in a Code Block."

## Product Backlog Epic Template

<!-- Utilize this template to construct an epic for your product backlog, guided by Tim Herbig's hypothesis approach -->

### Hypothesis

**We believe that** [an action or a solution on behalf of target beneficiaries]
**for** [the target beneficiaries of the action or solution]
**will achieve** [a desirable outcome or job-to-be-done for the target beneficiaries].

### Experiments

**We will test our assumption by:**
* [experiment 1]
* [experiment 2]
* [add more experiments as necessary]

### Validation

**We know our hypothesis is valid if within** [timeframe in days or weeks]
**we get:**
* [desirable quantitative measurable outcome]
* [desirable qualitative measurable outcome]
* [add more outcomes as necessary]
