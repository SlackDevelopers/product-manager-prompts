## Description:
This template is designed to help product managers and development teams create clear, concise user stories. It guides the formulation of user stories, ensuring they are structured to promote understanding and actionable outcomes. This template is particularly useful during Generative AI sessions, assuming enough product details, persona insights, positioning, and problem contexts have been already provided.

## Usage Note:
Ideal for use in Generative AI sessions where comprehensive background information (product details, personas, positioning, and problems) has already been established. This ensures the user stories generated are grounded in the project's context and objectives.
