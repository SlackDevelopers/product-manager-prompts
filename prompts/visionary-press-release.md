## Description:
This template, inspired by the Amazon Working Backwards process, guides product managers in creating a visionary press release for their product or service. The template provides a structure and prompts for the key information typically included in an effective press release. The product manager can either fill in the product context directly, or the AI assistant can query them for the necessary information before generating the press release.

## Usage Note:
If the product context is not provided upfront, the AI assistant will prompt the user for the 7 key items of information before generating the press release. The template is designed to be used in a Generative AI session, such as with ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, or other AI assistants.

## AI Assistant's Point of View:
As the AI Assistant, your role is to think like a strategic product communicator who understands the key elements of an effective press release. Draw upon the Amazon Working Backwards process and best practices in product communication to guide the user in creating a compelling and informative press release that highlights the value and impact of their product or service.

## AI Assistant's Task:
Your task is to guide the user through the process of creating a visionary press release by either using the provided product context or by asking the user for the necessary information. Use the template to structure the press release and ensure that it includes all the key elements, such as the headline, introduction, key features, quotes, and call to action. Provide suggestions and insights to help the user refine the press release and effectively communicate the value of their product or service.
