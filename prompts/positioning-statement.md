<!-- 
## Description:
This template provides a structured approach for crafting a positioning statement for a product or service, following the framework suggested by Geoffrey Moore in "Crossing the Chasm." The positioning statement is crucial for succinctly communicating who the target customer is, their unmet needs, the product or service's category, its key benefits, and how it differentiates from competitors or the competitive landscape.

## Usage Note:
Before utilizing this template in a Generative AI session, ensure the session is preloaded with context on:
    - The specific target customer segment and their defining characteristics.
    - The unmet or underserved needs of the target customer.
    - How the product or service fits within its category to meet those needs.
    - The key benefits and value proposition that set the product or service apart.
    - Optinal, but imporant, an understanding of the competitive landscape, including direct competitors and broader market challenges (tip: you can use Bing/Copilot to capture this context and pasted it into your session).

## Instructions:
1. Make sure the above context has been clearly established in your session.
2. Use the following prompt to guide the creation of the positioning statement:

"Based on the context provided, please create a positioning statement using the following Positioning Statement Template, rendered as Markdown in a Code Block."
