# Nightmares of Product Management Movie Title Generator Prompt.md

## INSTRUCTIONS

AI Assistant (that's you ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, or Gemini), I want to ask me a series of questions one at a time to help generate "Product Management Nightmares" in the style of 1950s and 60s B-horror movies, complete with titles, descriptions, and survival guides. Please follow these steps: 

1. **Ask Targeted Questions One at a Time**:
   - Ask the user three questions **ONE AT A TIME** to gather information about the specific scenarios they want to transform into horror movies, and wait for their response before asking the next question. 
     - Example questions:
       - "What product management challenge keeps you awake in the darkest hours of the night?"
       - "Who are the victims of this particular horror (individuals, teams, organization)?"
       - "What nightmarish consequences unfold when this terror is unleashed?"

2. **Follow These Rules to Generate Horror Movie Titles**:

   1. **Use Classic B-Movie Title Patterns**:  
      - Choose a title format following 1950s/60s horror conventions (e.g., "Attack of the...", "Invasion of the...", "The [Thing|Beast|Creature] from...", "The [Dawn|Bride|Terror] of...", "It Came from...", "The Day of the...", "Night of the...", "Curse of the...", "[Location|Monster] vs. [Location|Monster]", "I Was a Teenage...", "The [Person] with [something horrible]...", "The [Revenge|Wrath] of ...", "The Mutant Son of [Monster] ...")
      - Must reflect a genuine product management challenge

   2. **Title Must Be Meaningful**:  
      - The title should immediately evoke the specific product management horror while maintaining a period-appropriate style

   3. **Plot Structure Must Follow Classic Horror**:  
      - Start with peaceful normalcy
      - Show first signs of trouble
      - Reveal the full horror
      - Demonstrate mounting terror
      - Offer potential salvation

   4. **Metaphorical Alignment with Horror Tropes**:  
      - The horror movie monster/scenario should metaphorically reflect the PM challenge
      - Use classic B-movie elements (mutation, invasion, possession, etc.)

   5. **Clear Description of the Horror**:  
      - The nightmare should represent a specific PM anti-pattern or challenge
      - Keep it relatable despite the horror treatment

   6. **Memorability and Engagement**:  
      - The title should be campy yet professional
      - Use horror elements to make the lesson memorable

   7. **Aligns with Real PM Challenges**:  
      - The nightmare should represent actual problems PMs face
      - Solutions should be practical despite the horror presentation

   8. **Vincent Price-Style Narration**:  
      - Use subtle horror-host flourishes
      - Maintain a professional tone with elegant horror touches

   9. **Warning Signs and Survival Guide**:  
      - Include early warning signs of the horror
      - Provide practical survival tactics in horror movie terms

   10. **Clarity and Actionability**:  
       - Despite horror treatment, the message must be clear
       - Solutions must be implementable

3. **Generate the Nightmare Movie and Provide Details**:
   - Based on the user's responses, generate:
     - **A B-movie style title**
     - **A movie-poster style tagline**
     - **A plot synopsis including setup, horror, and survival**
     - **Three warning signs**
     - **Three survival tactics**

Please begin by asking the first of the three questions about my product management nightmare.
