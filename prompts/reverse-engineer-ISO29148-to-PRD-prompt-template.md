# reverse-engineer-ISO29148-to-PRD-prompt-template.md
<!--
## Description:
This template aids in the creation of a generative AI Product Requirements Document (PRD) fill-in-the-blanks prompt, reverse-engineered from the ISO 29148 StRS and BRS requirements standard. It is designed to help product managers construct structured and detailed fill-in-the-blanks PRD prompts for use with AI tools like ChatGPT. 
The template focuses on Stakeholder Requirements Specification (StRS) and Business Requirements Specification (BRS) to ensure comprehensive coverage of both stakeholder and business needs in product development.

## AI Assistant's Point of View:
Assume the role of a product manager with expertise in the ISO 29148 standard, guiding the creation of a versatile PRD prompt template that reflects the standard's emphasis on stakeholder and business/mission requirements. Focus on enabling the generation of effective PRDs by identifying key sections relevant to both StRS and BRS aspects, and adapt these sections to fit a fill-in-the-blanks format where the AI fills in based on provided context.

## AI Assistant's Task:
Help the user translate ISO 29148's focus on Stakeholder Requirements Specification and Business Requirements Specification into a flexible fill-in-the-blanks PRD prompt template. Offer advice on drafting succinct PRD prompt templates that can later be utilized by generative AI tools to fill in the blanks with specific product context. Ensure the template encompasses all critical aspects of stakeholder and business requirements as outlined by ISO 29148.

## Usage Note:
Intended for product managers seeking to use generative AI for creating detailed PRD prompt templates by reverse engineering standards like ISO 29148.

## Instructions:
1. Copy the template prompt below into your conversation with a generative AI tool.
2. Command the AI to develop a fill-in-the-blanks PRD prompt template mirroring ISO 29148's focus on StRS and BRS.
3. Modify the resulting prompt template as needed for clarity or completeness.
4. Use the finalized PRD prompt template with your generative AI tool to generate detailed PRDs specific to various products, following the embedded instructions.

## Roles

We'll work together as a product management team focusing on both stakeholder and business requirements.

## Task

1. Create a reusable fill-in-the-blanks PRD prompt template for generative AI assistants, derived from the ISO 29148 standard.
2. Generate a fill-in-the-blanks PRD prompt template that thoroughly addresses Stakeholder Requirements Specification (StRS) and Business Requirements Specification (BRS) according to ISO 29148. Provide guidance on the information required for each prompt and customization for different product specifics.
3. Format the generated fill-in-the-blanks template as Markdown within a code block, making it straightforward for product managers to apply it directly with AI tools for PRD detail population.
4. Include instructions for optimizing the template with AI tools to generate fill-in-the-blanks PRDs tailored to unique product requirements. These instructions should detail the preparatory information needed for effective AI assistance in PRD creation.

## Example

Partial Example of an ISO 29148-Based fill-in-the-blanks PRD Prompt Template:

### Product Requirements Document (PRD) Prompt Template

#### 1. Stakeholder Requirements Specification (StRS)

a. **Purpose and Objectives**: 
  - [Identify the overall goals and objectives that the product must achieve from the stakeholders' perspective.]
b. **Stakeholder Identification and Needs**: 
  - [List the key stakeholders and describe their specific needs and expectations from the product.]

#### 2. Business Requirements Specification (BRS)

a. **Business Objectives**: 
  - [Outline the primary business objectives that the product aims to support or achieve.]
b. **Market Analysis and Requirements**: 
  - [Provide a summary of market analysis findings and how they translate into product requirements.]

## Goal

The aim is to employ the structured approach of ISO 29148 to generate adaptable prompt templates for AI-driven creation of a PRD, focusing on capturing comprehensive stakeholder and business requirements.
In other words, the HUMAN doesn't fill in the blanks; the generative AI does.
