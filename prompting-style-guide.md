# Prompt Generation for Product Managers Style Guide 

### **Purpose:**
This guide assists in creating effective prompts for generating structured and insightful outputs using Generative AI (e.g., ChatGPT). It helps maintain focus and consistency, reducing the risk of session "drift."

### **Steps for Prompt Generation:**

#### **1. Define the Context:**
   - **What is the task or objective?** Clearly state the product management activity you want to address (e.g., crafting a positioning statement, exploring the problem space).
   - **Who is the target audience or customer?** Specify the relevant customer segment, their needs, and context.
   - **What is the scope?** Determine the areas the prompt should cover, such as functional, emotional, or social aspects.

#### **2. Use the [Fill in the Blanks] Structure:**
   - **Overview:** Provide a high-level description of the template's purpose and usage. 
   - **Specific Instructions:** Use the [fill in the blanks] method within Markdown, with instructions enclosed in `<!-- comment blocks -->` to guide the AI in generating content. This approach ensures that the output is both relevant and actionable.

   **Example Structure:**
   ```Markdown
   # template-name.md
   <!-- 
   ## Description:
   Provide a concise description of what this template is for and how it should be used.

   ## Usage Note:
   Include any specific context or preparatory steps needed before using this template with Generative AI.

   ## Instructions:
   Provide clear instructions on how to run the prompt, specifying any key elements to include.

   ```markdown
   ## Template Section
   * **[Title/Topic]**: [Detailed instructions for filling in the content based on the context provided.]
   ```
   ```

#### **3. Incorporate Bullet Points and Descriptions:**
   - **Bullet Points:** Use bullet points for clarity and structure. 
   - **Couple with Descriptions:** Each bullet point should include a title or topic followed by a description or instruction on what the AI should generate.

   **Example:**
   ```Markdown
   ### 1. Identify Problems
   * **[Regulatory Compliance]**: [Describe the regulatory challenges the customers face and how these impact their operations.]
   ```

#### **4. Think Like a Product Manager:**
   - **Focus on Outcomes Over Outputs:** Optimize your prompts to generate content that focuses on the 'who' and 'why' (the outcomes), rather than just the 'how' (the outputs).
   - **Understand the Customer:** Ensure the prompt helps uncover the deeper needs, pains, and gains of the customer, rather than just technical solutions.

#### **5. Maintain Consistency with Prompts:**
   - **Stick to the Structure:** Use the same format for similar tasks to ensure consistency across different sessions.
   - **Reuse Successful Prompts:** If a prompt worked well in one session, reuse or adapt it for other tasks to maintain focus.

### **Common Sections for Product Management Prompts:**

#### **Positioning Statements**
   - **Target Customer/User**: Describe the customer and their unmet needs.
   - **Product/Service Category**: Define the category and the benefits.
   - **Differentiation Statement**: Highlight how the product/service stands out from competitors.

#### **Customer Circle (Jobs-to-be-Done)**
   - **Customer Jobs**: Break down into functional, social, and emotional jobs.
   - **Pains**: Identify challenges, costliness, common mistakes, and unresolved problems.
   - **Gains**: Explore expectations, savings, adoption factors, and life improvements.

#### **Problem Space Exploration**
   - **Identify Problems**: Categorize into environmental, functional, and emotional challenges.
   - **Prioritize Problems**: Distinguish between core, peripheral, and long-term problems.
   - **Contextual Considerations**: Address external influences and internal constraints.

### **Final Tips:**
   - **Review and Iterate:** Always review AI-generated content with your team to refine and expand upon the ideas.
   - **Keep it Simple:** Avoid overloading the prompt with too much detail; aim for clarity and focus.
   - **Prepare for Session Drift:** If the session starts to drift, reset by revisiting the original context and goals.
