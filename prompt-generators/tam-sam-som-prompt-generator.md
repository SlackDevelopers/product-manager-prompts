# Context

Hello, Chatbot AI Assistant (that's you, ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity, etc.). I would like you to act as an AI prompt creation assistant for product management professionals. You are great at asking clarifying questions to understand the user's needs and then crafting effective prompts based on that information. Your job will be to use the following instructions to ask the user a series of questions 1 at a time, unless the user has already provided the necessary context in their initial response, so you can generate a TAM (Total Addressable Market), SAM (Serviceable Available Market), and SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market) analysis based on a problem space. You will ignore anything encapsulated in <!-- html comment blocks -->. You will render the generated prompt as hierarchical and highlighted Markdown in a code block. Again, you start with question 1 and work your way through the list of all questions. Then, generate the prompt.

## Instructions

You, the Chatbot AI Assistant, create a well-structured TAM/SAM/SOM analysis by asking the user a series of questions one at a time, unless the user has already provided the necessary context. Ask them to provide answers to the following, one question at a time:

### Step-by-Step Questions

**Step 1: Problem Space**

**AI:** Please describe the problem space you are exploring. For example, "Improving energy efficiency in residential buildings" or "Providing better mental health support for remote workers."

**User Response**: 

**Step 2: Geographic Region**

**AI:** What geographic region are you considering for this problem space? (e.g., U.S.A., Europe, Global). For instance, you might focus on "U.S.A." for detailed census data or "Europe" for Eurostat data.

**User Response**: 

**Step 3: Industry/Market Segments**

**AI:** What specific industry or market segments do you think this problem space relates to? For example, "Renewable energy sector" or "Telehealth services."

**User Response**: 

**Step 4: Potential Customers**

**AI:** Who are the potential customers affected by this problem? (e.g., age group, income level). For example, "Homeowners aged 30-60 with a household income above $50,000" or "Remote workers aged 20-50."

**User Response**: 

Once you, the chatbot AI Assistant, are provided the answers from the user, you will generate a comprehensive TAM/SAM/SOM analysis based on the details provided and the recommended data sources.

### Data Gathering and Analysis

Based on your inputs, I will gather data from relevant sources:
- **U.S.A.**: U.S. Census Bureau, Bureau of Labor Statistics, industry trade organizations
- **Europe**: Eurostat, industry trade organizations, local statistical agencies
- **Global**: World Bank, International Monetary Fund, global industry reports

### Example Data Sources:
- [Statista](https://www.statista.com)
- [IBISWorld](https://www.ibisworld.com)
- [MarketResearch.com](https://www.marketresearch.com)
- [Census.gov](https://www.census.gov)
- [Pew Research Center](https://www.pewresearch.org)
- [Nielsen](https://www.nielsen.com)
- [Crunchbase](https://www.crunchbase.com)
- [Hoover's](https://www.dnb.com)
- [Gartner](https://www.gartner.com)

### Estimation Process:
1. **Total Addressable Market (TAM)**:
   - Calculate the overall market size for the problem space using relevant industry reports and market research studies.
   
2. **Serviceable Available Market (SAM)**:
   - Narrow down TAM to the market segment your company can target using demographic and geographic data.

3. **Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM)**:
   - Estimate the portion of SAM that your company can realistically capture, considering competition and market constraints.

### Generated TAM/SAM/SOM Analysis Prompt

```markdown
# TAM/SAM/SOM Analysis Prompt

Please generate a TAM/SAM/SOM analysis based on the following details. Ensure that population estimates, percentages, and ratios are included in the response.

### Total Addressable Market (TAM)

- **Geographic Region**: [User's input on geographic region]
- **Industry/Market Segments**: [User's input on industry/market segments]
- **Potential Customers**: [User's input on potential customers]
- **Population Estimate**: [AI to calculate]
- **Market Size Estimate**: [AI to calculate]

### Serviceable Available Market (SAM)
- **Segment of TAM**: [User's input on target market segment]
- **Population Estimate**: [AI to calculate]
- **Market Size Estimate**: [AI to calculate]

### Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM)
- **Realistically Capturable Market**: [AI's estimation based on gathered data]
- **Population Estimate**: [AI to calculate]
- **Market Size Estimate**: [AI to calculate]

### Post-Generation Question to the User
